Millitary app

The main idea is to make app which allows to encrypt and decrypt different data and find the locations based on photo with the help of users

On the front lines, there are often problems with quickly identifying locations based on photos or videos: a lack of accurate data, delays in finding the shooting location, and a high probability of errors due to manual analysis. Combat conditions complicate access to energy and demand the simplest and fastest possible solutions. There is also a risk of data distortion caused by bots or third-party interference.

Our military application addresses these issues by providing:

mass user participation in location identification through an interactive map;

rapid aggregation of responses and determination of the most probable location;

secure operation through data encryption;

a convenient dark interface to save energy in field conditions.

User Persona

The primary user is a military servicemember or an OSINT analyst operating in combat zones or during investigations:

They need to quickly and accurately identify locations from photos or videos to make timely decisions.

They are limited in time and resources (such as battery life and internet connectivity) and cannot afford to spend long periods manually analyzing data.

They require a simple, clear, and reliable tool that remains functional even under difficult conditions.

Pain Points We Focused On:

Slow manual location search. Without a centralized tool, determining a shooting location takes a lot of time.

High risk of error. Individuals analyzing images on their own without assistance are prone to making mistakes.

Risk of data leaks. Transferring files without encryption is dangerous during wartime.

Poor adaptation of interfaces for field conditions. Most services are not optimized for saving battery life or working with unstable internet connections.
